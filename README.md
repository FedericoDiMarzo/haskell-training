### Haskell Training ###
In this repository, I collected my solutions to the exercises proposed in the [cis1940 course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html).
The exercises are still work-in-progress.

## Run the exercises ##
In order to execute the code of the exercises, install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and run the following command inside the inner directory haskell-training.

```bash
stack ghci
```
